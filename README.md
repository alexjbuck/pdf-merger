# PDF Merger

A client-side PDF merger that runs entirely in the browser as a single `index.html` file. Drop or select multiple PDF files, reorder them via drag-and-drop, and merge them into one downloadable PDF. No server, no build step — all processing happens locally using [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/). Encrypted/password-protected PDFs are detected and skipped with a warning.
